# HematopoiesisModelComparison
## Comparison of different lineage hierarchy models describing hematopoiesis

 required software: 
- MATLAB (R2017a), usage of Toolboxes:
  - PESTO (https://github.com/ICB-DCM/PESTO/)
  - AMICI (https://github.com/ICB-DCM/AMICI) 
  - STRIKEGOLDD (https://github.com/afvillaverde/strike-goldd_2.1)
 
  which are already included in folder 'tools' but need to get unzipped. Note that AMICI uses '.mex' files and requires MinGW as C/C++ compiler.   If you have not used mex with MATLAB before you might need to set it up first (by following these instructions: https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-mingw-support-package.html).
